This is a library to parse SMF MIDI files. It is fully unit tested.

To use this library, write a callback object and pass it to the MidiLexer, along with a MIDI file. The Lexer will call events on the callback as they occur in the file.

To install, run: 
	go get "github.com/afandian/go-midi"

To use it in your programs:
	import midi "github.com/afandian/go-midi"

See the examples for how to use.
