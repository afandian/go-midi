This is a library to parse SMF MIDI files. It's my first Go project and I'm working through http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~ich/classes/mumt306/midiformat.pdf without making reference to any other code to try to make it as idiomatic to Go as possible. 

The aim is to have full unit tests for every function and exceptional flow, to produce a robust and precise library.

The library is split into layers:

MidiLexer takes an io.ReadSeeker and an object that conforms to MidiLexerCallback. MidiLexer is an event-based lexer, which calls methods on the callback object.

MidiParser is an object that conforms to MidiLexerCallback. It takes a callback of type MidiParserCallback, and provides an extra layer of interpretation.

To use this library, either write a callback that conforms to MidiLexerCallback to get the raw stream (not recommended) or a callback that conforms to MidiParserCallback (recommended).

io.ReadSeeker --> MidiLexer <-- MidiLexerCallback <-- MidiParserCallback

There is a full test suite, including mock objects for the io.ReadSeeker.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, currently working on writing and testing MidiLexer.
